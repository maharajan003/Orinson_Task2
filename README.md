Salary Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression
Project Overview:
This project predicts an individual's salary based on their years of experience using Simple Linear Regression. It demonstrates how a straightforward regression model can provide insights into a linear relationship between features and a target variable.

Key Features
Input Feature: Years of Experience
Target Variable: Salary
Developed a Simple Linear Regression model to understand the relationship between experience and salary.

Dataset
Source: Salary_date.csv
Dataset Description:
Feature: Years of Experience - Number of years an individual has worked.
Target: Salary - Annual salary of the individual.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
sklearn for building and evaluating the regression model

Model Development
Data Preprocessing:
Loaded and explored the dataset.
Checked for missing values and cleaned the data if necessary.
Model Training:
Implemented Simple Linear Regression using sklearn.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20% split).
Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Results
The model achieved:
MSE: 9785570.138914308
R-squared: 0.9816423482070253
Visualization of the regression line showed a clear linear relationship between years of experience and salary.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Simple Linear Regression in understanding and predicting salaries based on years of experience. The model can be extended with additional features for better accuracy and insight.
